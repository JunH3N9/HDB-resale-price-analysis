Intro

As a year long intern at HDB, I frequently get funny questions from relatives and friends. Do you work at the construction site? Can you help me get a BTO? Which BTO is the best to get?

While the first 2 are silly questions, I did start to think about that last question. What really determines if a BTO is the "best". By my definition, the "best" would be the one with the most return on investment (ROI). But what were the factors that determines the value of a BTO? How could I use those factors to predict the resale price? After further research, I found that there were publicly available data on HDB resale transactions on data.gov.sg.

I employed statistical and geospatial analysis to undertsand and find trends in the resale prices. I was also reminded of a module I took called "AI Tools & Techniques for Cybersecurity". There, I learnt the basics of training a machine learning model. Thus, I embarked on the journey to develop a machine learning model to predict the potential resale price of a HDB flat.

A once light hearted question has been made into a machine learning model that is able to provide insights into the current HDB resale market.

I hope this project will be as funny to you as it was to me!
